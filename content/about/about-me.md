I'm currently a full-stack engineer with complete software lifecycle experiences in both large companies and startup environments.

I first started programming in the late 90s by making Java applets for old-school D&D-style MUD games and have dabbled in multiple languages and frameworks ever since. More recently, I've been migrating sections of monolith architectures into microservice Rest APIs in a Kubernetes environment with Go, Python's FastAPI, Protobufs, Kafka, and Firebase. I've also been testing front end frameworks like Svelte for production use and Hugo for static site generation.
